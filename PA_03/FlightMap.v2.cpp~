  *			 Initial development and testing of Map2 class
  *
  * @note Requires FlightMap.v2.h
  *
  * @note Not much of a difference from this file to FlightMap.v1.cpp. 
  * 	  Increases the efficiency of isPath function by checking another array
  *		  of booleans, and it implements the flight numbers and prices and
  *		  outputs those.
