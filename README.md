# CS302
Course: Data Structures

This course was taken in the Fall of my Sophomore year (Fall 2016).

CS302 taught me exactly what data structures are and how to use them in an efficient way. Starting with lists and working our way through stacks, lists, vectors, trees, and graphs, we created many commonly used algorithms that implemented these data structures. We developed and compared the runtime efficiency of sorting algorithms and process scheduling algorithms. We designed and tested binary search trees and red black trees. We used a stack to implement a shortest path algorithm which is commonly used in graph data structures.

Overall, CS302 was a course that I felt very passionate about, and I spent a lot of time on the projects to make them as perfect as I could given my experience level.

This repository contains 100% my code and my methods in solving the problems given to us.
